## Project Description

The goal of this project is for you to apply the things that we have learned in the previous lessons in data visualizations with python and derive Business Intelligence insights. For this project, you will choose a data set and explore it using Python. You will put together a Story using different visualizations for presentation showing the insights you have derived from the data. You should demonstrate your proficiency using Python and the concepts you have learned throughout the chapter. 

**You will be working individually for this project**, but we'll be guiding you along the process and helping you as you go. Show us what you've got!

## Project Goals

During this project you will:

- Manage your own git repository.
- Build your own code from scratch.
- Put into practice data processing concepts learned so far.
- Apply different visualization techniques to derive interesting insights.
- Practice public presentations skills.

## Technical Requirements

The technical requirements for this project are as follows:

* You must construct a Story using visualizations consisting of at least 5 different plots for the data set you have chosen.
* Choose a different visualizations types for each of the 5 plots. Try to implement the concepts that we covered in the chapter (sorting, filtering, different , aggregations, etc.)
* Save the file in the python-bi-project in GitHub, and your data should be saved to a folder named data.
* You should also include a README.md file that describes the steps you took, your thought process as you built your visualizations


## Necessary Deliverables

The following deliverables should be pushed to your Github repo for this chapter.

* **A Jupyter notebook uploaded to GitHub** that contains the visualizations you created from your data set.
* **A data folder** containing the data set you used for your project.
* **A ``README.md`` file** containing a detailed explanation of your approach and code for constructing visualizations and organizing them into a Story as well as your results, obstacles encountered and lessons learned.

## Presentation

The presentation time limit is **10 minutes**! You will have **7 minutes** to present your project to the class and then **3 minutes** for Q&A.

The slides of your presentation must include the content listed below:

- Title of the project + Student name
- Description of your idea and project
- Plots and insights for them
- Challenges
- Process
- Learnings
- If I were to start from scratch...
- Improvements
- Highlights

Tip: you have only 7 minutes for this presentation so keep it simple!

## Suggested Ways to Get Started

- **Examine the data and come up with a deliverable** before diving in and applying any manipulation methods. Specify the specific task beforehand. You will probably spend less time on project if you specify the task and expected outcomes beforehand. Raise questions, come up with some hypotheses to be tested.
- **Break the project down into different steps** - use the topics covered in the lessons to form a check list, add anything else you can think of that may be wrong with your data set, and then work through the check list.
- **Use the tools in your tool kit** - your knowledge of intermediate Python as well as some of the things you've learned in previous chapters. This is a great way to start tying everything you've learned together!
- **Work through the lessons in class** & ask questions when you need to! Think about adding relevant code to your project each night, instead of, you know... *procrastinating*.
- **Commit early, commit often**, donâ€™t be afraid of doing something incorrectly because you can always roll back to a previous version.
- **Consult documentation and resources provided** to better understand the tools you are using and how to accomplish what you want.
